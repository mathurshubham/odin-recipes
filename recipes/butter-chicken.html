    <h2>Description</h2>

    <b>Butter chicken </b>, traditionally known as <b>murgh makhani</b>. It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture.
    <br>

    <br>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.

    <br>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.

    <h3>How to make Butter Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Marinate the chicken</h4>
        Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.
        <br>
        Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li><h4>Soak cashews and almonds</h4>
            Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.
        </li>

        <li><h4>Cook the chicken</h4>
            Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.<br>
            Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.
            <br>Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.


        </li>

        <li><h4>Start making the sauce</h4>
        Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.<br>

        Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.<br>

        Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.
        </li>

        <li><h4>Purée the sauce with the nuts</h4>
            Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked, drained cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.

        </li>
        
        <li><h4>Finish the dish</h4>
            Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.<br>
            As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>

        <li><h4>Rest the butter chicken</h4>
            Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.

        </li>
        
        <li><h4>Serve</h4>
            Serve the butter chicken with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for up to 5 days.<br>
            You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.
